# FocuMoji

FocuMoji is a Flutter project that combines productivity with fun by offering a unique focus timer experience. This app allows users to set up custom timers and, upon successful completion, rewards them with a collection of 1299 emojis to unlock. These emojis are categorized and displayed on the rewards screen. Unlocked emojis are highlighted with a yellow background, and users can tap on them to view when they were unlocked and which timer led to their unlock.
